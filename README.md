## Description of Generated Piece
This is a groovy song that makes you want to tap your feet due to an awesome drum beat. There are no lyrics to distract you from whatever work you might be trying to accomplish, but it helps you get in the right work mood by giving you something pleasant and uplifting to listen to. The song features a slow build that reaches its height with the incorporation of a cool laser noise that pleasantly grabs your attention. Once it reaches its height, the song begins to unwind by slowly taking out different elements that were added in the first half. The final few notes of the song are some pleasant "kalimba" notes that are soothing and playful. Overall the song is an exprience that takes you from a simple beginning to an upbeat and joyful climax before slowly unwinding you back down to a calming end. This is music that could easily be played in the background of any event, used for studying, or even for a relaxing drive along the Maine coast. Enjoy!

## Running the Code
To easily run the code, start with all of the stop statements uncommented. This song is comprised of many live_loops and by having stop statements in each loop you are able to slowly construct and deconstruct a song by just commenting and uncommenting these stop commands. I personally went in a linear fashion to build the song up, starting with piano, then drums, then some extra sounds (wooshes and hums), finally ending with some melody parts and even a laser noise. When deconstructing the song for the second half, I went in a somewhat random order. I started phasing out different parts of the drum beat, some of the noises, until I was left with just a melody line and the base piano part. You could do this in order you want by just uncommenting the stop commands to create a vastly different sounding song. For example, you could start with just drums (just a bass drum beat) and build from there in any order you wanted. Or you could start with one of the melody lines and incorporate the drums later. There is lots of room for creativity in this regard.
